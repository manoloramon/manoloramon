### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi there! I'm a Flutter developer passionate about crafting beautiful and performant mobile apps. My experience with Flutter includes building apps from scratch, integrating with APIs, and creating custom widgets and animations.

In my projects, I prioritize clean and maintainable code, using architecture patterns like BLoC and Provider to ensure scalability and testability. I also pay attention to UI/UX details and aim for pixel-perfect designs that are intuitive and delightful to use.

Some of my recent projects include a social media app with real-time chat and notifications, a fitness tracker with custom animations and gamification features, and a weather app with dynamic backgrounds and location-based data.

I'm always looking to learn and improve my skills, and I enjoy collaborating with other developers on open-source projects. Feel free to browse my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or feedback. Let's build something great together
